# UPBHI (Utilizing Pangenomes to predict Bacteriophage-Host Interactions)

hg_features.py: can be used to extract features (-f) from pangenome databases and separate files or extract interactions (-i) from a phage-bacterium interaction matrix.

kmer_features.py: Create k-mer composition features from a folder counting k-mer counts.

model_training.py: Train and validate models predicting phage-host interactions.

For usage of scripts see their respective model docstrings.
